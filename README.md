## üß† Overview
CELEBI (**Compressive-Expressive Language Emergence through a discrete Bottleneck and Iterated learning**)  
is a self-supervised framework for **inducing compositional representations** through a **communication game**
between a _sender_ and a _receiver_.  

It extends the **Lewis Reconstruction Game** framework with three key mechanisms:

1. **Progressive Decoding (PD)** ‚Äì The receiver reconstructs the input after each symbol, promoting efficiency and interpretable intermediate reasoning.  
2. **Final-State Imitation (FiSI)** ‚Äì During iterated learning, the student reproduces only the final reconstruction of the teacher, enforcing a tighter generational bottleneck.  
3. **Pairwise Distance Maximization (PDM)** ‚Äì A regularizer that increases message diversity and approximates entropy maximization.

Together, these pressures foster **compositionality**, **efficiency**, and **expressivity** in emergent communication.
